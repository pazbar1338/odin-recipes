    <p>It’s football season and what appetizer is better with game-day then crispy baked chicken wings?! Seriously,
        these little guys are the bomb.com! They’re baked to crispy perfection, and then tossed in the most delicious
        sweet and spicy buffalo sauce. They’re totally addicting and perfect for game day! Make them ASAP, and then
        thank me later! </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken wings</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
        <li>Buffalo sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Dry the wings well with paper towels. This is essential to getting a crispy coating.</li>
        <li>Toss with dry spice rub. Combine the salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika, and baking powder in a small
            bowl. Then sprinkle the seasoning over the wings, tossing to evenly coat.</li>
        <li>Bake. Arrange wings, skin side up and bake, turning every 20 minutes until wings are crispy and browned. The
            total cook time will depend on the size of the wings but may take up to 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Toss in sauce. Remove from oven allow to rest for 5 minutes before tossing in desired sauce. I made a quick
            buffalo sauce with Franks hot sauce, sugar and water.</li>
    </ol>
