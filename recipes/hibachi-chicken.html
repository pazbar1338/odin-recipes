    <p>If you’ve ever been to a Hibachi restaurant you know that you’re in for both dinner and a show! The first time I
        went was with my family when I was a teenager, and now it’s a fun date-night restaurant we love to go to a few
        times a year.</p>

            season with salt and pepper. Cook one minute then add 1 Tbsp butter, 1 Tbsp soy sauce and garlic to skillet
